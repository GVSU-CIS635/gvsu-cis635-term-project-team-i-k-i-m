**Crime Prediction Using LSTM Networks**
This project aimed to predict crime occurrences in the Portland area using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The key learnings and technologies explored include:

**Technologies Used:**
Python Libraries (NumPy, pandas, geopandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow), Machine Learning (Long Short-Term Memory), and Google Colab.

**Key Learnings:**
1. Data Preprocessing: Merged and preprocessed geospatial data from multiple years for training and testing the LSTM model.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis, including plotting crime occurrences over time, monthly crime counts, average crimes per month, and average crimes for each day of the week.
3. Spatial Analysis: Explored spatial aspects of crime data, including plotting police districts, analyzing crime hotspots within police districts, and dividing the area into grid cells for analysis.
4. Model Training: Trained an LSTM model to predict future crime occurrences based on historical data.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predictions and actual occurrence locations.
   
**Conclusion:**
This project demonstrated the potential of LSTM networks in predicting crime occurrences based on historical geospatial data. By leveraging spatial and temporal information, the model could provide valuable insights for law enforcement agencies in crime prevention and resource allocation.
